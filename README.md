# AllergyAway Application

AllergyAway is an interactive application that warns users about possible food item allergies.
The user simply has to create an account, input their allergies, and scan the barcode of whatever food item they plan to consume. 
The app then returns whether or not the food item has any of the user's allergies.

This app was made using the Flutter (Dart) language, on the Visual Studio code IDE. 
OpenFoodFacts API was used to access the global food product database
Google's Firebase was used to catalog the user's allergies.
